# Deep Learning based Chatbot Architecture for Medical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation

Introducing a smart medical chatbot architecture to improve healthcare accessibility and quality.

### Abstract

With the exponential growth and rapid development in the fields of deep learning and neural networks, chatbots have gained a lot of popularity and have become a proven, and efficient tool to interact and provide service to users. Healthcare is one of the most promising fields where chatbots can be used more efficiently. This has become important, especially in the current medical landscape, where there is a shortage of doctors, and patients often have to wait long periods before getting any medical guidance. By using the power of transformer models and machine learning algorithms chatbots can help patients with personalized diagnoses and treatment recommendations, efficiently at ease and convenience. This helps the patients to access medical services anywhere, at any point in time. This paper proposes a well-planned systematic architecture for a medical chatbot that utilizes the potential of transformers, classification algorithms and machine-learning models. The architecture includes three main components: a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, a Binary Tree classifier along with a Support Vector Classifier, and a sequence-to-sequence model. These algorithms are used to classify symptoms and determine the severity of a medical condition to provide patients with accurate medical diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Overall, the proposed architecture is built and designed to bridge the gap between doctors and patients by providing immediate access to medical advice, making it a promising tool for improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.
